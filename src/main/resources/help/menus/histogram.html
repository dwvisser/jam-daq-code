    <h3>Group</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>New Group...</dt>
      <dd>Create a new group with the given name.</dd>
      <dt>Rename Group...</dt>
      <dd>Rename the selected group.</dd>
      <dt>Delete Group...</dt>
      <dd>Delete the selected group.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>New...</h3>
    <p>
      The user creates a new histogram and adds it to the drop-down list.
      <em>Name</em> is a short (up to 16 characters) name for the histogram to
      go on the dropdown list. <em>Title</em> is a longer descriptive name for
      the histogram, which is displayed in the plot panel and on printouts.
      <em>Type</em> is either a <code>1</code> or a <code>2</code>, the
      dimensionality of the histogram. <em>Size</em> is the number of channels
      in the histogram, and is usually a power of two. For example, to make a
      1024 channel histogram, the user would enter <code>1024</code> in
      <em>Size</em> and the resulting histogram will have channels numbered 0
      thru 1023.
    </p>
    <h3><a name="zero">Zero...</a></h3>
    <p>
      Three buttons are on this dialog. <em>Displayed</em> will zero the
      currently displayed histogram. <em>All</em> will zero all histograms in
      memory. <em>Cancel</em> lets one quit the dialog without zeroing anything.
      <strong>Warning: there is no safety feature on this. Once you click a button,
        the histogram contents are gone!</strong>
    </p>
    <h3>Delete...</h3>
    <p>Completely remove the currently displated histogram.</p>
    <h3>Calibrate...</h3>
    <p>
      Calibrate the displayed histogram, either by entering coefficients or
      asking for a fit. Each histogram can store its own calibration function.
    </p>
    <h3>Projections...</h3>
    <p>
      Project a 2-d histogram into a 1-d histogram. The entire histogram, a
      slice, or the contents of a gate may be projected. The destination
      histogram may be an existing histogram or a new one which you name.
    </p>
    <h3>Combine...</h3>
    <p>
      Add, subtract, multiply or divide a pair of 1-d histograms into either a
      new histogram you name, or an existing histogram. You may also renormalize
      an existing histogram (into a destination histogram) by multiplying the
      bin counts by a constant.
    </p>
    <h3>Gain Shift...</h3>
    <p>
      Apply a gain shift to the displayed histogram into a user-specified
      destination histogram. Area is conserved.
