<H2>Fitting Spectra</H2>

<p>Right now there is only one fitting routine available in <span
class=jam>jam</span>, called <code>GaussianFit</code>.  This fit routine can fit
a single Gaussian peak with a quadratic polynomial background.  In order to use
it, first go to the <span class=jammenu>Fitting</span> menu and load it via the <span class=jammenu>Load Fit...</span> dialog.</p>

<p>You will be presented with a dialog box which has spaces for the fit
parameters, their fit errors, and options.  Clicking <span class=jambutton>Get
Mouse</span> will allow you to enter the needed channels.  Clicking <span class=jambutton>Do Fit</span> calls methods in
<a href="../../API/jam/fit/NonLinearFit.html">NonLinearFit</a>
to find a best fit for the selected peak.   <code>NonLinearFit</code> uses the
Levenberg-Marquadt
method of seeking a minimum chi-square statistic for a fit.  This method
requires the parameters to be reasonably well guessed, so that they are already
near the (hopefully global) minimum.</p>

<p>  In the case of <code>GaussianFit</code>, a
method called <code>estimate()</code> takes care of some of the work of guessing
parameters by pre-calculating area, width, and background level.  Clicking <span
class=jambutton>Draw Fit</span>  will draw a curve for the presently entered
parameter values in the dialog box. After fitting, the program automatically draws its best fit.</p>

<p>It is possible to write your own fit routines for <span class=jam>jam</span>.
 All you need to do is extend the abstract class <a href="../../API/jam/fit/NonLinearFit.html">NonLinearFit</a>
by implementing the methods <code>estimate()</code>, <code>valueAt()</code>, and
<code>derivative()</code>.  Your constructor will define your parameters, which
are instances of the <a href="../../API/jam/fit/Parameter.html">Parameter</a> 
class.</p>
