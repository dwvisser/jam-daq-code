<LI><A HREF="#camac">Setup</a> the <span class=acronym>CAMAC</span> crate. 
Define all the cnafs that need to be performed to initalize and read the <span class=acronym>adc</span>'s.</LI>

<A NAME="camac"><H3>Camac</H3></A>
To set up the camac crate you need to enter the list of <span class=acronym>CNAF</span>'s that
have to be performed. Go to the <span class=jammenu>Setup|Camac</span> dialog box where the list can be entered.

The lists are:

<p><span class=jammenu>INIT</span>--
The list that gets performed at startup time. Here is where you should put all the module initialization and setup commands.</p>

<p><span class=jammenu>EVENT</span>--The list that gets performed for every event. These read the <span class=acronym>ADC</span>'s and <span class=acronym>TDC</span>'s for every event.</p>

<p><span class=jammenu>SCALER</span>--The list that get performed when the scalers are to be read. You can also read an <span class=acronym>ADC</span> here, although it would only be read when the scalers are.</p>

<p><span class=jammenu>CLEAR</span>--The list that gets performed at a scaler's clear. It can also be used to clear other modules at the same time as clearing scalers.</p>

<p><span class=jammenu>USER</span>--The list that gets performed at a user input. There is currently now way to perform this list currently, but it would a way to do at list of <span class=acronym>CNAF</span>'s at the push of a button.</p>
