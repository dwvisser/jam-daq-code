<h2>Histogram Menu</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>New...</dt><dd>The user creates a new histogram and adds it to the drop-down list. <em>Name</em> is a short (up to 16 characters) name for the histogram to go on the dropdown list.  <em>Title</em> is a longer descriptive name for the histogram, which is displayed in the plot panel and on printouts.  <em>Type</em> is either a <code>1</code> or a <code>2</code>, the dimensionality of the histogram.  <em>Size</em> is the number of channels in the histogram, and is usually a power of two. For example, to make a 1024 channel histogram, the user would enter <code>1024</code> in <em>Size</em> and the resulting histogram will have channels numbered 0 thru 1023.</dd>
  <dt><a name="zero">Zero...</a></dt><dd>Three buttons are on this dialog.  <em>Displayed</em> will zero the currently displayed histogram. <em>All</em> will zero all histograms in memory. <em>Cancel</em> lets one quit the dialog without zeroing anything. <b>Warning: there is no safety feature on this.  Once you click a button, the histogram contents are gone!</b></dd>
  <dt>Delete...</dt><dd>Completely remove the currently displated histogram.</dd>
  <dt>Calibrate...</dt><dd>Calibrate the displayed histogram, either by entering coefficients or asking for a fit. Each histogram can store its own calibration function.</dd>
  <dt>Projections...</dt><dd>Project a 2-d histogram into a 1-d histogram. The entire histogram, a slice, or the contents of a gate may be projected. The destination histogram may be an existing histogram or a new one which you name.</dd>
  <dt>Combine...</dt><dd>Add, subtract, multiply or divide a pair of 1-d histograms into either a new histogram you name, or an existing histogram. You may also renormalize an existing histogram (into a destination histogram) by multiplying the bin counts by a constant.</dd>
  <dt>Gain Shift...</dt><dd>Apply a gain shift to the displayed histogram into a user-specified destination histogram. Area is conserved.</dd>
