<h2>File Menu</h2>

<p>Most commands in this menu access disk files.  All state in the command title what the standard extension to the filename is.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>New</dt><dd>--Erase histograms, scalers, and gates...start fresh.</dd>
  
  <dt>Open(hdf)...</dt><dd>--Enabled if no sort file has been loaded.  Reads in histograms and scalers from an <a href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/hdf4.html">HDF 4.1r2-formatted</a> file, replacing any data currently being viewed.</dd>
  
  <dt><a name="reload">Reload(hdf)...</a></dt><dd>--Enabled only if a sort file has been loaded.  Replaces data in Histogram, Gate and Scaler objects with the data in any identically named objects in the file.</dd>
  
  <dt><a name="save"Save(hdf)</a></dt><dd>--Saves all gates, scalers, and histograms in memory to the current HDF file.</dd>
  
  <dt>Save as...(hdf)</dt><dd>--Same as save, except the user is prompted with a file dialog to name the file.</dd>
  
  <dt>Import/Export</dt><dd>--import/export spectra from other data formats.</dd>
  <dl>
    <dt>ASCII...</dt><dd>
    Jam expects ASCII files to have data organized in rows with numbers in those rows separated by "whitespace", i.e., spaces or tabs. Any number representing counts in a bin may be a floating point number, and in fact, the histogram created uses floating point numbers to represent bin counts. If the first line in the file has text not starting with a numeral, the first line will be used to generate the name of the histogram. Otherwise, the filename is used. One- and two-column files are assumed to contain a one-dimensional histogram. The row number (starting at zero) is the channel in one-column files. The format for two-column files is channel number and counts in pairs separated by white space, e.g. <blockquote><code>0 4<br>1 3<br>2 0<br>...<br></code></blockquote>
    Three-column files are assumed to be two-dimensional histograms stored in "x y z" format. Any file with more than 3 columns is assumed to be in matrix form, with tabs between elements and carriage returns between rows. Jam exports 1-d histograms as 2-column ASCII files, and 2-d histograms as matrix-form ASCII files.</dd>
    
    <dt>ORNL .drr .his ...</dt><dd>--This is a multiple spectrum (1- to multi- dimensional) file format, written by Milner for use at Oak Ridge National Lab.  The files always come in pairs, a <code>filename.drr</code> directory file and a <code>filename.his</code> histogram file.  The <code>filename</code> before the period is the same for both.</dd>
    
    <dt>Radware .spe</dt><dd>--This is the 1-d histogram format used by the gf2 program.</dd>
    
    <dt>XSYS .dat ...</dt><dd>--Imports spectra (no export capability) using the <span class=acronym>XSYS</span> format. <span class=acronym>XSYS</span> is a data acquistion program written at Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory. It has been used at the University of Washington
Center for Experimental Nuclear Physics and Astrophysics.</dd>
    <dt>Batch Export...</dt><dd>--A dialog for exporting a list of histograms to a selected folder in one selected format all at once. The filenames are the histgram names plus the default file extension for the selected format.</dd>
        <dt>JHF Format</dt><dd>--A duplicate set of Save, Save as..., Open... and Reload... commands using a previous file format, which is no longer supported. All work gets saved using the <a href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/hdf4.html">HDF 4.1r2</a> format now.
</dl>
<dt>Print Setup...</dt><dd>--Sets the options in the print dialog box.</dd>
<dt>Print...</dt><dd>--Brings up the print dialog box, and lets you send the print job.</dd>
<dt>Exit...</dt><dd>--Exits the program after receiving verification in a final dialog box.</dd>
