<h2>File Menu</h2>

<p>Most commands in this menu access disk files.  All state in the command title what the standard extension to the filename is.</p>

  <h3>Clear data...</h3><p>Erase histograms, scalers, and gates...start fresh.</p>
  
  <h3>Open...</h3><p>Enabled if no sort file has been loaded.  
  Reads in histograms and scalers from an 
  <a href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/hdf4.html">HDF 4.1r2-formatted</a> file, 
  replacing any data currently being viewed.</p>
  
  <h3><a name="reload">Reload...</a></h3><p>Enabled only if a sort file has been loaded.  Replaces data in Histogram, Gate and Scaler objects with the data in any identically named objects in the file.</p>
  
  <h3><a name="save">Save</a></h3><p>Saves all gates, scalers, and histograms in memory to the current HDF file.</p>
  
  <h3><a name="saveas">Save as...</a></h3><p>Same as save, except the user is prompted with a file dialog to name the file.</p>
  <h3>Special</h3>
  <dl>
  <dt>Open Selected Histogram...</dt>
  <dd>After selecting an HDF file, you are given a dialog to select on histogram 
  contained in the file. You may type a short <em>File Indicator</em> in the given field
  to help uniquely identify the histogram once loaded.</dd>
  <dt>Save gates, scalers and parameters as...</dt>
  <dd>Same as <a href="#saveas">above</a>, except no histograms are saved in order to 
  save disk space, reduce access time, and make it easy to reload gates later on.</dd>
  </dl>
  <h3>Utilities</h3>
  <dl>
  <dt><a name="dispscal">Display scaler values from YaleCAEN event file...</a></dt>
  <dd>Gives you a file dialog from which to choose an event file, which <em>must</em>
  be YaleCAEN formatted for this feature to work. Once selected, the file is scanned 
  and a dialog is popped up with a tab-delimited text table of all the stored scaler
  blocks that were in that file. It is possible on most systems to select and copy this
  text to your favorite external program.</dd>
  <dt>Scan HDF files for scaler values...</dt>
  <dd>Gives you a dialog where you must specify the experiment name that was used for
  the HDF files, the path containing the files, and a range of runs to scan the files
  for. Clicking OK or Apply then launches a process which reads the scaler values out
  of all the HDF files and constructs a text table just like the 
  <a href="#dispscal">above</a> command.</dt>
  </dl>
  <h3>Import and Export Menus</h3><p>Import spectra from or export them to other data formats.</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Text File</dt><dd>
    Jam expects ASCII files to have data organized in rows with numbers in those rows separated by "whitespace", i.e., spaces or tabs. Any number representing counts in a bin may be a floating point number, and in fact, the histogram created uses floating point numbers to represent bin counts. If the first line in the file has text not starting with a numeral, the first line will be used to generate the name of the histogram. Otherwise, the filename is used. One- and two-column files are assumed to contain a one-dimensional histogram. The row number (starting at zero) is the channel in one-column files. The format for two-column files is channel number and counts in pairs separated by white space, e.g. <blockquote><code>0 4<br>1 3<br>2 0<br>...<br></code></blockquote>
    Three-column files are assumed to be two-dimensional histograms stored in "x y z" format. Any file with more than 3 columns is assumed to be in matrix form, with tabs between elements and carriage returns between rows. Jam exports 1-d histograms as 2-column ASCII files, and 2-d histograms as matrix-form ASCII files.</dd>
    
    <dt>Oak Ridge DAMM</dt><dd>This is a multiple spectrum (1- to multi- dimensional) file format, written by Milner for use at Oak Ridge National Lab.  The files always come in pairs, a <code>filename.drr</code> directory file and a <code>filename.his</code> histogram file.  The <code>filename</code> before the period is the same for both.</dd>
    
    <dt>Radware gf3</dt><dd>This is the 1-d histogram format used by the gf2 program.</dd>
    
    <dt>TUNL's XSYS</dt><dd>Imports spectra (no export capability) using the <span class=acronym>XSYS</span> format. <span class=acronym>XSYS</span> is a data acquistion program written at Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory. It has been used at the University of Washington
Center for Experimental Nuclear Physics and Astrophysics.</dd>
    <dt>Batch Export...</dt><dd>A dialog for exporting a list of histograms to a selected folder in one selected format all at once. The filenames are the histgram names plus the default file extension for the selected format.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Print...</h3><p>Brings up the print dialog box, and lets you send the print job.</p>
<h3>Page Setup...</h3><p>Sets the options in the print dialog box.</p>
<h3>Exit...</h3><p>Exits the program after receiving verification in a final dialog box.</p>
