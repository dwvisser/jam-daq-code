<H2>Offline Sorting</H2>


<p>Setting up Jam to sort event data takes only a few easy steps:</p>

<OL>
<LI><A HREF="sortfile.html">Write</a> a sort routine. 
This is done before Jam is started. In a sort routine, all the histogram and 
gates are defined, and you write the procedure to process each event. You will need a editor and Java compiler for this. The best approach, however, is to use an
  <a href="http://links.javalobby.org/Developer_Tools/IDE/index.html">integrated development environment</a>
  Eclipse. The IDE we develop Jam on is <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>.&nbsp;
</LI>
<LI>Start up Jam. 
</LI>
<LI><A HREF="#setup">Setup</A> of the offline sorting. This entails loading
the sort routine and event streams you would like to use.
</LI>
<LI><A HREF="#reload">Read</A> in previously defined gates if needed.
</LI>
<LI><A HREF="#sorting">Specify</A> which files to sort and
begin the sort.</LI>
<LI><A HREF="#save">Save</A> the sorted spectra.
</LI>
</OL>

<H3>Setup of the sorting</H3>
<A NAME="setup">
Open up <span CLASS=jammenu>Setup|Offline</span>. Load your sorting
class to use, and event streams for input and output.

<H3>Read in previously defined gates</H3>
</a>
<A NAME="reload">
If you needed read in a hdf file that has previously defined gates in it,
using <span CLASS=jammenu>File|Reload</span>.
<BR> 
You might also need to zero all histograms, use
<span CLASS=jammenu>Histograms|Zero</span>
 
<H3>Specify which files to sort and begin sort</H3>
</a>
<A NAME="sorting">
Open the sort dialog <span CLASS=jammenu>Control|Sort</span> 
where you specify which files, (runs for tape) to sort, and
begin the sort.
Select the list of files you want to sort using: 
<span CLASS=jammenu>Add file</span>,
<span CLASS=jammenu>Remove file</span>,
<span CLASS=jammenu>Remove All</span>.
<BR>
If this list is more than a few files long you might
want to save the list. 
You can save this list of files using
<span CLASS=jammenu>Save list</span> 
and subsequently load it using
<span CLASS=jammenu>Load list</span> 
<BR>
To start the sort click on <span class=jambutton>Begin</span>.
To stop the sor click on <span class=jambutton>End/Cancel</span>,
not this is not a pause, it kill the sort process. 
After ending a sort you will have to setup to sort again.

<H3>Saving sorted spectra</H3>
</a>
<A NAME="save">
Save the sorted spectra and gates in a hdf file 
with <span CLASS=jammenu>File|Save</span>.
