<H2>Online Sorting</H2>

<p>Setting up Jam to take data takes only a few easy steps:</p>

<OL>
<LI><A HREF="sortfile.html">Write</a> a sort routine. 
This is done before Jam is started. In a sort routine, all the histogram and 
gates are defined, and you write the procedure to process each event. You will need a editor and Java compiler for this. The best approach, however, is to use an
  <a href="http://links.javalobby.org/Developer_Tools/IDE/index.html">
  integrated development environment</a>, such as <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>.
</LI>

<LI>Start up Jam and make sure that the <span class=acronym>VME</span> 
computer (with the <a href="http://www.windriver.com/"> VxWorks</a> operating system) is and running.</LI>


<LI><A HREF="#sorting">Setup</a> the sorting. Tell Jam which sorting
routine to use, how to name the event and histograms files and the 
paths to use to write out the data and histograms files. 
</LI>
<LI><A HREF="#acquisition">Starting</a> the acquisition. 
There are two ways to take data, just acquisition and run mode.
</LI>

</OL>


<A NAME="sorting"><H3>Setup Online Sorting</H3></A>

<p>To set up online sorting you need to open the <span CLASS=jammenu>Setup|Online</span> 
dialog box. There are four text fields you need to fill in. 
<span class=jamfield>Experiment Name</span> is used to name the data files. 
The event data and histogram files are named with the name of the experiment with the run number 
appended, e.g. <code>AlphaTest100.hdf</code> and <code>AlphaTest100.evn</code>. It is best to make 
the name of the experiment descriptive. <span class=jamfield>Sort File (.class)</span> is a sort routine that was written by the experimenter. There is no need to add the <code>.class</code> extension. <span class=jamfield>Path for Histograms</span> and <span class=jamfield>Path for Events</span> are the absolute paths for storage of histograms and events.</p>

<H3>Starting and stopping the acquistion system</H3>
<p>To start and stop the data acquisition without saving the events, 
use the menu items <span CLASS=jammenu>Control|start</span> and <span CLASS=jammenu>Control|stop</span>. 

<H3>Running: taking event data</H3>
To save the event data you need to begin a run. Open the <span class=jammenu>Control|Run...</span> dialog box to do this.
<span class=jambutton>Begin</span> will open a new event file and start acquisition. 
The event file will be create in the directory specified in the <span class=jammenu>Setup|Online</span>
 dialog box.
<span class=jambutton>End</span> will stop acquisition, close the event file, 
and write out a HDF file which if the appropriate boxes are checked, will contain the histogram, gates, and scalers.
