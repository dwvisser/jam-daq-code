<h2>Writing a Sort Routine</h2>
<p>A sort routine for Jam is written as a Java class. The sort 
routine must extend the <span class=jam>Jam</span> class, 
<code>jam.sort.SortRoutine</code>. This allows the full flexibility of the Java
language, but also requires you follow a certain syntax so that your class is a
valid extension.</p>
<p>A basic sort routine has several sections:
<ol>
    <li><i>The declaration section:</i> Here you declare names for 
    the variables representing, among other things, references to 
    your histograms, gates, scalers, monitors and run-time 
    parameters.  Declarations made here are visible throughout 
    the sort routine, i.e., in all subsequent sections.</li>
    <li><i>The initialization section:</i> Here you create all 
    your data objects and perform any other tasks to initialize 
    the sort routine's state when it is loaded into Jam. Give your 
    Histograms, Gates, and Scalers the properties you want, e.g., 
    name, size, type, and title, etc.</li>
    <li><i>The sort section:</i> This part of the sort routine is 
    called by Jam for every event. It the place to test gate 
    conditions and increment histograms.</li>
    <li><i>The monitor section (optional): </i>This section can be used to calculate the
return value of certain Monitor objects.</li>
	<li><i>The "begin run" routine (optional):</i> If you include the 
	<code>begin()</code> subroutine, Jam calls it 
	during online acquisition when the user 
clicks on <a href="online.html#beginrun">Begin</a>. If the 
<em>Zero Histograms</em> checkbox is selected, 
the histograms are zeroed <em>after</em> <code>begin()</code> is
called.</li>
	<li><i>The "end run" routine (optional):</i> If you include the
	<code>end()</code> subroutine, Jam calls it during online 
	acquisition when the user 
clicks on <a href="online.html#endrun">End</a>. 
<code>end()</code> is only called
after Jam has had a chance to sort all events from the run.</li>
<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>You must follow a certain format to create
a sort routine that is a valid subclass of the <code>jam.sort.SortRoutine</code> class.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
Your sort routine file name must have the same name as the class name. For
example, the class <tt>MySort</tt> must reside in a file name MySort.java</li>
<li>
Your sort class must extend the Jam class <code>jam.sort.SortRoutine</code>, as
follows:
<br> <code>import jam.sort.SortRoutine;</code>
<br> <code>public class MySort extends SortRoutine {...}</code></li>
<li>
You must have an initialize() method, as follows:
<br><code>public void initialize() throws Exception{...}</code> </li>
<li>
You must have a sort() method, as follows:
<br><code>public void sort(int [] eventData) throws Exception {...}</code> </li>
<li>For offline sorting
you may define your event size with <code>setEventSize(size of eventData array)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the skeleton of a minimal sort class:</p>

<pre><code>
import jam.sort.SortRoutine;

public void MySort extends SortRoutine {

    &nbsp;/*variable, histogram and gate delerations go here ... */

   public void initialize() throws Exception {
    &nbsp;/* initialization code goes here... */
   }

   public void sort(int[] eventdata) throws Exception {
    &nbsp;/* sort code goes here... */
   }
}</code></pre>

<h3>Variables</h3>

As of Jam 1.6.0, there are some changes which simplify and shorten the way Histograms are 
declared and created 
in sort routines. It will, however, require users to change and re-compile old sort 
routines in order to use them with the new version. For example, to create a 2048 channel 
1D histogram and a 512x16 2D-histogram, the declaration and creation would look like:

<pre>HistInt1D sample1d=createHist1D(2048,"ADC Channel 0");
HistInt2D sample2d=createHist2D(512, 16, "AngVsE", "Angle vs. Energy","Energy","Angle");</pre>

<p>Here are all the possible forms:</p>
<pre>createHist1D(int chans, String name, String title, String labelX, String labelY);
createHist1D(int chans, String name, String title);
createHist1D(int chans, String name);
createHist2D(int chX, int chY, String name, String title, String labelX, String labelY);
createHist2D(int chX, int chY, String name, String title);
createHist2D(int chX, int chY, String name);
createHist2D(int chans, String name, String title, String labelX, String labelY);
createHist2D(int chans, String name, String title);
createHist2D(int chans, String name);</pre>

<p>If a form which omits axis labels is used, the default axis labels are "Channels"
or "Counts" as appropriate. If a form which omits the title is omitted, the name is
used as the title. If a form of <code>createHist2D()</code> with only one <code>chans</code>
parameter is used, then the histogram is assumed to have the same number of x-channels as
y-channels.</p>

<p>Variables can either be primitive types (e.g., <code>int</code> or <code>double</code>)
or a class (for example <code>Histogram</code> or <code>Gate</code>). Whereas a
intrinsic variable can just be allocated a value (e.g., <code>number=4</code>),
each new instance of a class, which is called an object, must explicitly
created using the <code>new</code> keyword followed by a constructor for that
class. A constructor is the class name given with the parameters needed
to create it. For example, the constructor for a gate is <code>Gate(String name,
Histogram hist)</code>  where you must provide the parameters: <code>name</code>
and <code>hist</code>. Look at the example below, keeping in mind that 
<code>HistInt1D</code> is a subclass of <code>Histogram</code>, and therefore instances
of <code>HistInt1D</code> are also <code>Histogram</code>'s:<p>

<pre>HistInt1D h1;
Gate g1;

h1 = createHist1d(8192, "Germanium 1");
g1 = new Gate("g1", h1);</pre>

<h3>Classes</h3>
The classes that are available for you in sort class are:
<h4>Data Classes</h4>
<dl>
   
<dt><a href="../API/jam/data/Histogram.html">Histogram</a></dt>
<dd>
A histogram displays data. It can be one or two dimensions,
and it can be integer or floating point.

<dt><a href="../API/jam/data/Gate.html">Gate</a></dt>
<dd>
A gate is a condition on histogram channels, which can be interactively set.
The condition is lower and upper limits in one dimension 
or a polygon region in two dimensions.

<dt><a href="../API/jam/data/Scaler.html">Scaler</a></dt>
<dd>
A scaler is an object which stores values from an electronic scaler unit in your experiment.

<dt><a href="../API/jam/data/DataParameter.html">DataParameter</a></dt>
<dd>
A parameter which can be set at runtime to pass values to the sort routine.

<dt>
<a href="../API/jam/data/Monitor.html">Monitor</a></dt>
<dd>
A monitor is a class that allows rates in an experiment to 
be monitored.
</dl>

<p>For more information on using any of these classes, download Jam's API documentation, and look
at the <code>jam.data</code> package.</p>

<h4>Utility Classes</h4>

<p>Sort routines you write that extend <code>jam.sort.SortRoutine</code> are provided
with pre-existing instances of several useful utility classes.</p>
<h5>Electronics Configuration</h5>
<dl>
<dt>Pre-existing instance, <code>cnafCommands</code>, of 
the class <code>jam.sort.CamacCommands</code></dt>
<dd>This is a class whose methods you call to setup a CAMAC crate.</dd>
<dt>Pre-existing instance, <code>vmeMap</code>, of the class 
<code>jam.sort.VME_Map</code></dt>
<dd>This is a class whose methods you call to setup a VME crate using CAEN V775 and V785
ADC's.</dd>
</dl>
<h5>Calibration</h5>
<p>There is a pre-existing instance, <code>gains</code>, of the class 
<code>jam.sort.GainCalibration</code>, which may be used to load a gain calibration text
file and easily apply those gains to incoming raw data.</p>

<p>For more details on these classes, download Jam's API documentation, and browse
to the <code>jam.sort</code> package.</p>

<h3>Sort Routine Examples</h3>
<h4>CAMAC-based Acquisition Systems</h4>
<p><a href="../sortfiles/CamacSortTemplate.html">Here</a> is a template of a sort 
routine with two histograms and one gate.
One histogram is incremented for every event while the second histogram
is only incremented if the event falls in the first histograms gate.
For <code>cnafCommnands</code> the <code>c,n,a,f</code> would have to be replace by 
actual values.</p>
<p>A more complete example of a CAMAC-based sort routine may be found 
<a href="../sortfiles/EvsDE.html">here</a>.</p>
<h4>VME-based systems using CAEN V7x5 ADC's and TDC's</h4>
<p>Here is a version of a sort routine used at LENA, modified here for
demonstration purposes: <a href="../sortfiles/CI.html">CI.java</a></p>
