<H2>Fitting Spectra</H2>

<p>Spectrum fitting routines are loaded by going to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fitting</span> menu and
selecting the name from the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Load Fit...</span> dialog. Once you have loaded
the fit routine, it will be available from the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fitting</span>
menu. Fitting routines always attempt to fit the currently displayed histogram.
Right now there are two fitting routines available in <span
class=jam>Jam</span>. <code>GaussianFit</code> can fit
a single Gaussian peak with a quadratic background.  
<code>PeakIntensity</code> will extract the area minus a linear
background for any peak shape.</p>

<h3>Fitting a Gaussian peak</h3>

<p>You will be presented with a dialog box which has spaces for the fit
parameters and their fit errors. There are also checkboxes for some parameters
for fixing their values, or letting the routine <a href="#estimate">estimate</a> in initial guess.
Click <em>Get
Mouse</em> to enter the channels by clicking on the displayed histogram.  Click 
<em>Do Fit</em> to call methods in
<a href="../API/jam/fit/NonLinearFit.html">NonLinearFit</a>
to find a best fit for the selected peak.   <code>NonLinearFit</code> uses the
Levenberg-Marquadt
method to find a minimum chi-square statistic by varying the fit parameters from
an initial guess.  This method
requires the parameters to be reasonably well guessed, so that they are already
near the (hopefully global) minimum.</p>

<p><a name="estimate"></a>An optional
method called <code>estimate()</code> takes care of some of the work of guessing
parameters by pre-calculating area, width, and background level.  Clicking 
<em>Draw Fit</em>  will draw a curve for the presently entered
parameter values in the dialog box. The <em>Draw Fit</em> button is useful for manually finding
good initial guesses. After fitting, the program automatically draws its best fit.</p>

<h3>Using PeakIntensity</h3>
<P><code>PeakIntensity</code> works in a very similar way. Select the extremes of
the region to fit with the parameters "Low Channel" and 
"High Channel". Then select two channels immediately to either side of the peak
using "Low Peak" and "High Peak". A linear background is fit to the background
region outside the peak, and the area and centroid are returned for the peak itself. 
The background is plotted on the histogram.</p>

<h3>Writing your own fit routines</h3>

<p>It is possible to write your own fit routines for <span class=jam>jam</span>.
Write a class which extends the abstract class <a href="../API/jam/fit/NonLinearFit.html">NonLinearFit</a>
by implementing the methods <code>valueAt()</code>, and
<code>derivative()</code>, and optionally <code>estimate()</code>.  
Your constructor will define your parameters, which
are instances of the <a href="../API/jam/fit/Parameter.html">Parameter</a> 
class. You <em>must</em> place the fit routine on your classpath in a package named
"fit".</p>
